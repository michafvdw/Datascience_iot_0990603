This projet measures lux with the TSL 2591 sensor. The data will be send to the bluefruit app on a phone using the bluefruit LE module (a bluetooth module made by adafruit). With the app in UART mode you can check if its dark or light in a room. 

## lux
Lux is the SI derived unit of illuminance, measuring luminous flux per unit area. It is used to measure the intensity (as perceived by the human eye) of light that hits or passes a surface. In other words, the TSL 2591 measures the light intensity in a room.
